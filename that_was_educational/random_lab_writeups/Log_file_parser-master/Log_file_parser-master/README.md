In this project you will design, implement, and test a log file parser that parses raw command data produced by another program.   
Raw command data have the following characteristics: 
1.	In the raw command log file: 
 
   a.	Address column indicates memory addresses in hex 

   b.	Data column contains the data in hex at the memory address 

   c.	Size column indicates whether data is 32-bit (D32) or 64-bit (D64) 

   d.	Cycle column indicates whether data is being written into or read from the memory address (Wr=Write, Rd=Read) 

   e.	RelTime column indicates how long the action in the previous row took (ex: the action in row 2 took 157.5ns, which is logged on row 3) 

2.	Address 0x40000810 contains the length of the S-to-D command in number of bytes 
3.  Address 0x40000818 to 0x40000C14 contains the data of the S-to-D command 
4.	Address 0x40000C18 contains the length of the D-to-S command in number of bytes 
5.	Address 0x40000C20 to 0x4000101C contains the data of the D-to-S command 
6.	A command can have anywhere between 1 to 42 words 
7.	A word is always 16-bit 
8.	The command words can have one of the following two memory layouts: 
  
  a.	Little endian: least significant word (word 0) at lowest address and most significant word (word N) at highest address 

  b.	Big endian: most significant word (word N) at lowest address and least significant word 
    (word 0) at highest address 

  c.	To learn more about little vs big endian: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness  

9.	The data of S-to-D command use little endian word ordering 
10. The data of D-to-S command use little endian word ordering 
11.	The bits of a word can have one of the following two bit numberings: 

  a.	LSB 0: least significant bit is bit 0 and most significant bit is bit 15 

  b.	MSB 0: most significant bit is bit 0 and least significant bit is bit 0 

  c.	To learn more about LSB vs MSB: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering   

12.	All command words in the tables below use LSB 0 bit numbering scheme. 
13.	Word fields: 

                              Word 	Bits 	Field Name 	Description 
                              Word 	Bits 	Field Name 	Description 
                              0 	14-13 	Rec_Ctrl 	0=no recording 
                              2=no processing 
                              3=processing & recording 
                              1 	15-13 	Cmd_Type 	4=Type A, 5=Type B, 6=Type C 
                              4 	0 	Rec_Raw 	0=disable, 1=enable 
                              5 	6-0 	Cmd_ID 	Command ID 
                              10 	15-11 	Num_Responses 	Number of responses 
                              15 	2 	Reset_Enable 	0=disable, 1=enable 
                              22 	3 	Direction 	0=Right, 1=Left 
                              32 	14-0 	Num_Samples 	Number of samples 
                              37 	15 	Parity 	0=even, 1=odd 
                              38 	14 	Test 	0=disable, 1=enable 
                              40 	7 	Ctrl_Enable 	0=disable, 1=enable 
                              41 	14-8 	Code 	Code value 

Software Requirements: 
1.	The parser shall read a log file that contains raw command data and produce a text file with parsed command data 
2.	The parser shall parse rows with addresses 0x40000810, 0x40000818 to 0x40000C14, 0x40000C18, 0x40000C20 to 0x4000101C 
3.	For each command in the log file (as explained in the above section) the parser shall output the following: 
  
  a.	The line number (of the data in input log file), the type of cycle (i.e. “Read” or “Write”), the type of command (i.e. “S-to-D” or “D-to-S”) and number of words (1 to 42) on the same line.  Examples:   
  
      i.	Line 496: Read S-to-D command: 16 words   

      ii.	Line 17698: Write D-to-S command: 42 words 
  
  b.	The parsed data of each word in the command, one field per line.  For each field indicate the line number (of the data in input log file), the Word Number, the Field Name, the value of the field, and if available the meaning of the value.  Examples:  
  
      i.	Line 707: Word 0: Rec_Ctrl = 3 (processing & recording) 
  
      ii.	Line 709: Word 4: Rec_Raw = 0 (disable) 
  
  c.	An example of one actual parsed command: 

      i.	Line 196: Write S-to-D command: 6 words 

      ii.	Line 197: Word 0: Rec_Ctrl = 0 (no recording) 

      iii.	Line 197: Word 1: Cmd_Type = 1 (unknown) iv. Line 199: Word 4: Rec_Raw = 0 (disable) 

      v. Line 199: Word 5: Cmd_ID = 6 
  
  d.	There shall be one blank line between each command and no blank line within a command 
  
  e.	Print the words in a command in ascending order, i.e. word 0 before word 1 before word 2, etc. 
  
  f.	When command data in input log file is in reverse order, print the words in a command in descending order, i.e. word 41 before word 40 before word 39, etc. 
  
  g.	An example of one actual parsed command where the words are in reverse order: 
    
      i.	Line 695: Write S-to-D command: 12 words 

      ii.	Line 696: Word 10: Num_Responses = 0 iii. Line 699: Word 5: Cmd_ID = 6  

      iv.	Line 699: Word 4: Rec_Raw = 0 (disable) 

      v.	Line 701: Word 1: Cmd_Type = 1 (unknown) vi. Line 701: Word 0: Rec_Ctrl = 0 (no recording) 

4.	You shall calculate the data rate for each type of “Read S-to-D”, “Read D-to-S”, “Write S-to-D”, “Write D-to-S”.  The data rates should be accurate to 2 decimal places and use Kilobits/sec or Megabits/sec or Gigabits/sec or Terabits/sec as appropriate.  Print the data rates at the end of the output file.  Example: 

  a.	Read S-to-D: 25.73 Kilobits/sec 
  
  b.	Read D-to-S: 53.01 Megabits/sec 
  
  c.	Write S-to-D: 154.24 Gigabits/sec 
  
  d.	Write S-to-D: 1.22 Terabits/sec 
  
  e.	Note that RelTime column indicates the amount of time the read/write of the PREVIOUS row took (note: ns = nanoseconds, us = microseconds, ms = milliseconds) 
  
5.	Run your program 3 times on the test_data.log input file during presentation in class to capture the 3 wall clock run times.  The average wall clock run time must be 2.0 seconds or less. 
  
  a.	Your runs must complete successfully (i.e. did not crashed or otherwise aborted midway).
